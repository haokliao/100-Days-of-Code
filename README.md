**Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Journey!**
 =============
I created this repository as a way to both have a central database for my work in the course, [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) located on Udemy. I'll be updating this repository almost daily, (most likely excluding Sundays) and keep track of my progress in the form of projects/assignments as well as any notes or lessons I've been taking through my journey.
