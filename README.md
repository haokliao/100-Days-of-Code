I created this repository as a way to both have a central database for my work in the course, 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021 located on [Udemy.](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) I'll be updating this repository almost daily, (most likely excluding Sundays) and keep track of my progress in the form of projects/assignments as well as any notes or lessons I've been taking through my journey. 

The first fifteen days for the course seem to be all based on an online IDE, Repl.it, so you can keep track of my progress [there!](https://repl.it/@haok)
I'll try figuring out some way to attach it to this repo, but bear with me because I'm brand new!
