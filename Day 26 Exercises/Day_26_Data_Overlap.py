#f1,f2 are two text files that contain random numbers 

# f1 = open('file1.txt','r')
# f2 = open('file2.txt','r')

# f1read = [int(i) for i  in f1]
# f2read = [int(j) for j  in f2]
# result = [k for k in f1read if k in f2read]

#we use list comprehension to iterate through f1read, and check to see if the variables iterated are in f2read
